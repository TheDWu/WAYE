# WAYE ( What are you eating)
---------------------------
Are you tired having to manually track all the macronutrients of everything you eat? You might eat 10 different things and have to track  and calculate 10 different intakes of  calories, protein , sodium, fats, fiber, the list goes on. On top of that, where are you going to keep track of this info? Excel? 
  Too much work we say!
  That's where WAYE comes in
  
 Description 
------------------------------
WAYE is revolutionary way to track what you are eating. Currently designed to track school dining hall foods, members are able to simply select what items they ate and WAYE does the rest by calculateing the total macro nutrients of everything you ate!  Additionally, members are able to look at indiviual items they ate and see its nutritional values. 

Whats Next for WAYE?
---------------------------------------
We are designing a food reccomendation system by allowing users to select certain ingridents they want or don't want in their food and the system will give reccomendations from the menu list.
